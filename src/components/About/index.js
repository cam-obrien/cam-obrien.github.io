                    I recently graduated from Oregon State University with a Bachelor's Degree in 
                    Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration. I am actively seeking
                    professional opportunities in software engineering.

                <p>
                    My time at Oregon State provided me with ample experience in many development fields.
                    I currently find myself most interested and experienced with full stack web development
                    but am open to new opportunites. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    My current plan going forward is to familiarize myself
                    with the professional software engineering environment to gear myself to become a project
                    manager or scrum master in the near future. I believe my development knowledge combined
                    with my communication skills place me in a unique position to lead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a new graduate I am extremely excited to get to work and make professional connections!
