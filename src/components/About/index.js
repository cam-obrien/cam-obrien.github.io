                        I am an Oregon State University graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and a Minor in Business Administration.
                        I am actively pursuing professional opportunities in cloud software engineering and architecture.

                        My time at Oregon State provided me with ample experience in many development fields.
                        I currently find myself most interested and experienced with full stack web development
                        but am open to new opportunites.

                    <p>
                        In recent months I have switched my focus to developing knowledge in cloud based architecture
                        and development. I have earned the AWS Solutions Architect Associate and Cloud Practitioner
                        Certifications and plan on continuing my pursuit for more. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a new graduate I am extremely excited to get to work and make professional connections!
