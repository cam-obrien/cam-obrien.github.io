I found this experience reignited my passion for web-based development as the tools provided were so\n                            powerful. The main piece of the website's functionality I was put in charge of was user authentication and sessions.\n                            I applied Django's libraries and was able to get these functionalities implemented in a short period of time. Perhaps\n                            one of the most valuable takeways from this project was documentation experience. This project is slotted to be taken\n                            over next year by a capstone team simialr to mine and eventually released as an open source project which required us\n                            to create extensive documentation on our work thus far.\n                            <br/><br/>\n\n                            <h3> Summation </h3>\n\n                            After nine months of development we were able to create a web application capable of providing users with the essential \n                            operations of a service like Learning Catalytics. I am unable to provide the source code of this project publically as it\n                            will be worked on further next year by another OSU capstone team.\n                        </p>\n\n                </Project>\n\n\n                <Project title=\"Spotify Wrapped API App\" subheading=\"Mobile Development | Kotlin &#38; Spotify API\">\n                    <p>\n                        <h3> Goals </h3>\n\n                        Create a mobile application that allows users to login to Spotify and show them their most listened to \n                        artists and songs. Users should be able to select a time period between one to six months along with either\n                        songs or artists to view their Spotify data. Once the top ten results of the user's desired information is\n                        displayed they should be able to select a result and navigate to Spotify's website to view more information in \n                        an intent.\n                        <br/><br/>\n\n                        <h3> Development</h3>\n\n                        I joined a team of three other developers to create this service over a one week period. We spent the first day of\n                        the project planning out the various screens of the application, researching Spotify's API including both API calls\n                        and login verification, and setting various goals to reach throughout the week. We spent the next few days in two teams\n                        asynchronously working on Figma designs and creating the base layer of the application's views. Once we had screen navigation\n                        and finalized Figma designs we implemented the login functionality. This provided us with more of a challenge than we \n                        anticipated and forced us to implement the result API calls and other features within the last day of development.\n                        <br/><br/>\n\n                        <h3> Takeaways </h3>\n\n                        Creating this application was my most API-involved development experience to date. While implementing the login functionality\n                        using Spotify's documentation was difficult at first I found it very gratifying once it was successful. I found the process of \n                        creating and manipulating the result API calls very fun as I was performing the operations on my own Spotify data. I now find\n                        myself very comfortable with API's as a whole and have taken higher interest in new projects involving API's as a result.\n                    </p>\n                    <a href=\"https://github.com/cam-obrien/SpotifyWrappedApp\" className=\"github-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> View This Project On My Github </a>\n                </Project>\n\n                <Project title=\"Retail Databases Interface\" subheading=\"Backend Driven Web Interface | Python &#38; SQL\">\n                    <p>\n\n                    <h3> Overview </h3>\n\n                    Our primary objective for this project was to emulate the creation of a web-based interface to be used in a retail setting to track\n                    product quantities, customer accounts, orders, various stores, and other essential business information. The the theoretical business\n                    we created this software for was a lacrosse focused equipment and merchandise store.\n\n                    <h3> Databse Design </h3>\n                    \n                    My teammate and I would spend the majority of this project's duration designing the database's tables, creating ERD diagrams and schemas,\n                    and testing the overall design of the database's implementation before working on the interface.
